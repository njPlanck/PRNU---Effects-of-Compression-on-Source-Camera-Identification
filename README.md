# Effect of Compression on Camera Identification via PRNU (Photo-Response Non-Uniformity)
This project demonstrated the application of Photo Response Non-Uniformity (PRNU) for source camera identification, emphasizing the challenges posed by image compression. By analyzing multiple compression formats and levels using classical filtering techniques, we were able to assess how PRNU patterns behave under varying degrees of image degradation.
In addition to forensic performance, we computed different quality metrics (the  PSNR and SSIM, for reference metrics and then BRISQUE, for the no reference quality metrics) to better understand the relationship between visual fidelity and fingerprint preservation. While classification accuracy reduced with as images were progressively degraded for gaussian filter, the results from sigma filter remained stable and even showed that as more scene information was removed due to compression, the correlation of the pattern noise to the reference pattern for each device improved across all standards.
Overall, our work highlights the ongoing relevance and reliability of PRNU-based identification methods, especially when appropriate removal of scene information is applied. This result support the use of filters like sigma filter ahead of gaussian filter in digital forensics because of their robustness in the presence of significant compression.

## Overview
The Photo Response Non-Uniformity (PRNU) is a fixed pattern noise introduced by a camera device during the manufacturing of the device.
Patterns like these are near invisible artifacts which make the device different from others.
This is such that when an image/video is acquired by a camera, it is possible to trace their source device.
For instance, images of the same scene captured with different camera have different pattern noise unique to each camera.
These noise are also be referred to as camera fingerprints/residue.

## Motivation
With the growing adoption of technology, we have also seen the rapid growth of the amount of media data that is shared and transferred between people, networks and devices. 
Once an image/video is shared, or transferred, it becomes very difficult to identify their source device where they must have been captured.
This is a big problem in multimedia forensics, as it is often necessary to check for data tampering and other abuses like leaks of illegal images/videos.
More especially as these media data usually undergo various forms and levels of compression when they are captured, uploaded and/or transferred from one device/network to the other


## Features
PRNU noise extraction with gaussian and sigma filter denoising.

Fingerprint averaging from multiple images per camera.

Fast and robust camera matching using FFT-based normalized cross-correlation.

Supports JPEG, PNG, JPEG2000 (.jp2), and JPEG XL (.jxl) image formats.

Automatic validation and evaluation using a confusion matrix.

## Output

Displays a confusion matrix comparing predicted vs. actual camera sources.

## How It Works
Training Phase:

Extracts PRNU noise from each image.

Computes an average noise fingerprint for each camera.

Testing Phase:

Extracts noise from a test image.

Compares it against each camera fingerprint using normalized cross-correlation.

Selects the camera with the highest similarity score.

## Notes
Ensure images are grayscale or are converted to grayscale.

Noise extraction uses wavelet denoising (BayesShrink) from scikit-image.

JPEG XL and JP2 decoding handled via Pillow and pyjxl.
